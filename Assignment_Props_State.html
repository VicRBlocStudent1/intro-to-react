                     this.state = {
                     x: "In a future lesson, we will cover a Java Script Library called React"
                     }

                    <div>
                        <h1>Hello {this.props.world}</h1>
                        <p>What Follows are two different examples of a {this.props.dataTypes} in JavaScript</p>
                        <p>Here we have an example of a string: {this.props.string} any text can be considered a string, this includes numbers too</p>
                        <p>Here is an example of a different {this.props.dataTypes}: {this.props.number} this, as you may have guessed is called a number</p>
                        <p>{this.state.x}. Briefly, React is a front end javascript library. Two Core principles of react are "state" and "props". It is important to know that "state" is declared and defined inside of a component, and is therefore unique to that component. "props" are declared and defined outside of the component, and this makes them reuseable in any component you create within a program. "props" are called immutable because they are passed into the parent component and can be passed to child elements of that component in whats called a unidirectional(one direction) flow. "state" can change based on the user interaction with the component in which a particular "state" resides. Event Handlers such as "onClick" can be used to create a number counter that could change each time a user clicked a button inside of a component.</p>
                        
                        
                    </div>
                    );
                }
            }

             Greeting.defaultProps = {
                   world: "World!",
                   dataTypes: "Data Type",
                   string: "'This is a string'",
                   number: 2
            }
            
            ReactDOM.render(
            <Greeting />, document.getElementById('app')
            );
